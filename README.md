# Proxy Hunter

[中文版說明](README.zh-TW.md)

## Overview

Proxy Hunter is a powerful Python tool designed for scraping and testing the availability of free proxies from [Free Proxy List](https://free-proxy-list.net/). It employs regular expressions to collect a list of IP addresses and tests their validity using [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/). It's an essential tool for developers and security analysts who require a quick and reliable method of obtaining free and working proxy servers.

## Features

- **Scrape Free Proxies**: Automatically scrapes free proxy servers from Free Proxy List.
- **Proxy Validation**: Checks the validity of each proxy server by attempting to connect to the internet using the proxy.
- **Output Customization**: Allows users to specify the output file for the list of valid proxies.
- **File-Based Proxy Check**: Supports checking the validity of proxies listed in a user-specified file.
- **Thread Control**: Choose how many threads are used for proxy validation.
- **Anonymous Proxy Filter**: Optionally keep only proxies that hide your real IP.
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Save results in plain text or JSON format.
